# Knight's Travails

## Overview

Knight's Travails is a Ruby program that calculates the shortest path a knight can take to move between two positions on a standard 8x8 chessboard. The program uses the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the optimal path and outputs the sequence of moves the knight will make to reach the target position.

## Features

* Validates input positions to ensure they are within the bounds of a chessboard.

* Implements the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path.

* Tracks visited positions to avoid unnecessary computation.

* Reconstructs and displays the path taken by the knight.

## How to Run

* Clone this repository or download the project files.

* Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the knight_moves.rb file.

* Run the program using the Ruby interpreter:

ruby '/knight_moves.rb'

* Modify the starting and target positions in the code to test different scenarios.

## Usage

* Given a starting position [0, 0] (bottom-left corner) and a target position [4, 3], the program will:

1. Validate the input positions.

2. Perform a BFS to find the shortest path.

3. Output the moves and the number of steps taken.

Output:

You made it in 3 moves! Here's your path:
[0, 0]
[1, 2]
[3, 3]
[4, 3]
